### ETL Using Prefect for the Coffee Shop Dataset:

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes are crucial for managing and analyzing the Coffee Shop Dataset, covering customer demographics, sales transactions, and inventory details. Using Prefect, we define Python workflows to extract data from MongoDB, transform it to derive metrics like daily sales, and load it back for analysis. Prefect's scheduling capabilities allow us to automate these tasks daily at 12 am, ensuring up-to-date insights into our coffee shop operations. This scheduled execution maintains data integrity, supports timely decision-making, and enhances overall operational efficiency.

### APIs for Accessing Analytical Insights:

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are integral to our project, enabling seamless access to analytical insights derived from the Coffee Shop Dataset. Through FastAPI, we expose endpoints that allow stakeholders to interact with our data-driven insights programmatically. These APIs facilitate queries such as retrieving daily sales trends, comparing sales performance across different stores, and analyzing customer demographics. By leveraging FastAPIâ€™s capabilities, we ensure that our APIs deliver efficient responses in JSON format, supporting integration with other applications or platforms. This approach enhances accessibility to critical business insights.
